Today we are going to explore some more features that Bootstrap offers us for web design.

## Getting started 👨🏽‍💻
1. I want you to click into [Trinket](https://trinket.io/).
2. Now click on the blue button, select **HTML** and create a new file called **Day 2 - Bootstrap**.

Now we need to add our boiler plate code again, just like last week.

### How Do You Use Bootstrap?
To use Bootstrap, you include its `CSS` and `JavaScript` files in your HTML document. 

- Remember to add these lines of code inside your `<head>` tags.
- This gives you access to all the pre-made styles and interactive features.

````html
<!-- Include Bootstrap CSS -->
<link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.3/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet">

<!-- Include Bootstrap JavaScript -->
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"></script>
````

Next, you need to add this line of code just above your closing body tag `</body>`.

````html
<!-- Bootstrap Scripts -->
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"></script>
````
